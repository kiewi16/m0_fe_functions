# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
*I really struggled to understand functions. I am proud of my self-learning and persevarence. I agonized over question #5 and finally gave up after several hours. I planned to attend office hours on Saturday night for help. However, after completing Problem Solving Challenges 1 and 2, I was able to solve question #5!* 
- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
*A function in JavaScript is powerful because it is a set of resuable instructions.*
